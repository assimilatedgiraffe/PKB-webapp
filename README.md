# Personal Knowledge Base Web App

##### Note taking web app built with Vue.js and Firebase.

Developed to overcome the limitations of regular note taking software as none of the many options available had all of the the specific features I wanted.

The basic structure is something like a cross between regular note taking software like Evernote and a mind map, where notes are organised in a tree structure and any note can have an unlimited number of child notes.

The app is intended for daily use and was therefore designed to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible.
